Unity Source code for project

Seascape scene: Tile based approach

Seascape2 scene: Terrain based approach

To change the number of fish generated, click on the empty GameObject (either TerrainGen or OceanFloor) 
and modify the fish number under the "GenerateFish" script.

Note: The rocks I used in the project were of a very high quality and thus increased the project to a size of approximately 200 MB, therefore
in the submission they have been replaced with spheres. 

The package containing the the original rocks used is available at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r6gc34mt9jocecu/Seascape.unitypackage
